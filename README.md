# Personal-website

## Architecture

### 01-pages
- The `01-pages` folder contains an individual folder for each webpage, with a name matching that of the HTML file for that specific page.

### 11-resources
- The `11-resources` folder contains all self developed files for the website.

### 21-global
- The `21-global` folder contains common files for the website. However these files are not written by me, such as JQuery plugins, certain CSS files etc.
